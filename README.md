# COVID-19-DATA-EXPLORATION PROJECT

This project explores COVID-19 data from November 2019 to November 2022. Basic to advanced SQL queries are executed to get solutions for the queries and look at trends over the course of COVID-19. After the data exploration is complete in SQL, the queries are used to create some data visualizations in Tableau. My data exploration in SQL can be viewed [HERE](https://github.com/charansai97/charansai97/blob/main/Data%20exploration%20in%20SQL.sql) and my dashboard in Tableau [HERE](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/charan.sai8631/viz/COVID-19DASHBOARD_16732470781580/Dashboard1?publish=yes).
